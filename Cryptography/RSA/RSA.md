# Understanding RSA mathematically!

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It involves the use of public and private keys for encryption and decryption.

## Understanding the Code

### Prime Number Check

The code begins by defining a function `isprime(n)` to check if a number is prime. It iterates from 2 to the square root of the number to determine its primality.

### Input Validation

Users are prompted to enter two prime numbers (`P` and `Q`). The function `check_primes()` verifies if both inputs are prime numbers.

### Calculation of N and Totient (Φ)

The product of `P` and `Q` (`N`) is calculated, which forms the modulus for both the public and private keys. Euler's Totient function (`Φ`) is also calculated using `(P-1) * (Q-1)`.

### Public and Private Key Selection

Users input a public key (`E`) and a private key (`D`). These keys must satisfy specific conditions:
- The public key must be a prime number, less than `Φ`, and not a factor of `Φ`.
- The private key (`D`) is selected such that `(D * E) mod Φ = 1`.

### Encryption

The user inputs a message to be encrypted. Each character in the message is converted to its ASCII value and then encrypted using the public key (`E`). The encrypted message is generated by raising the ASCII value to the power of `E` modulo `N`.

### Decryption

The encrypted message is decrypted using the private key (`D`). Each character in the encrypted message is decrypted by raising its ASCII value to the power of `D` modulo `N`.

### Security

RSA encryption is secure because the difficulty of factoring large numbers makes it computationally infeasible to derive the private key (`D`) from the public key (`E`) and modulus (`N`).

Mathematically, we can also interchange the public and private keys, and use the private key to encrypt and the public key to decrypt. Follows like a Commutative property of multiplication. ( A X B ) = ( B X A ). But practically, for real-world cases, this doesn't make sense.
